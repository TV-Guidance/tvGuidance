## Overview
### Description
Not too long ago, streaming services were not a thing! To find out if a movie or tv show was playing on cable, you would go to your trusty tv guide. In 2021 we need the tv guide of streaming services. Say no more! TV Guidance is an app where you can search for any movie or tv show and the guide will tell you where you can watch it on your favorite platforms!
